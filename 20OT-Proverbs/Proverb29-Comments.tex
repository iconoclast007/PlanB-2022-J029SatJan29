Israel's experience with this is described in a variety of places. Nehemiah 9:16, 9:17, and 9:29 recall Israel before the Babylonian deportation.\footnote{\textbf{Nehemiah 9:16-17} - But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments, [17] And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.}\footnote{\textbf{Nehemiah 9:29} - And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.}
A promise of this is made way back in Deuteronomy 32.
